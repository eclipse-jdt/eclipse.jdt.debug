/**
 * Implementations of this interface describe workspace projects for the purpose of source lookup. Implementations are registered with the advanced
 * source lookup framework using {@code org.eclipse.jdt.launching.workspaceProjectDescribers} extension point.
 *
 * Workspace project runtime classes location are used to identify projects when performing source code lookup. Depending on project type and
 * application classloading mechanism used by the runtime, classes location can be project output folders, one of project classpath entries (for PDE
 * Binary Plug-In projects, for example) or some other runtime-specific location, like OSGi bundle installation location.
 *
 * The same workspace project can have different classes location if it is used with different runtime technologies. For example, PDE Plug-In project
 * classes will have bundle installation location when used by Equinox framework and project output folder when used by standard java application.
 * Note that different runtime technologies can coexist within the same running JVM, like it is the case with Tycho build, where Equinox, Maven and
 * standard Java APIs are used side-by-side. For this reason multiple project describers can provide information about the same project and all
 * projects descriptions will be considered when performing source lookup.
 *
 * @since 3.10
 * @provisional This is part of work in progress and can be changed, moved or removed without notice
