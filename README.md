# JDT Debug

JDT Debug implements Java debugging support and works with any JDPA-compliant target Java VM.
It is implemented on top of the language independent "debug model" provided by the platform debugger. 
JDT debug provides the following debugging features:

- Launching of a Java VM in either run or debug mode
- Attaching to a running Java VM
- Expression evaluation in the context of a stack frame
- Scrapbook pages for interactive Java code snippet evaluation
- Dynamic class reloading where supported by Java virtual machine

If it is a serious bug, other people than you might care enough to provide a fix.
